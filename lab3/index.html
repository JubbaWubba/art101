<h1> The Subject of This Lab </h1>
<p> The subject of this lab is to learn how to structure and style your internal files as well as uploading these files into the internet.</p>
<h1> The difficulties </h1>
<p> Overall, nothing was extremely difficult within the entire process of this lab. What I had some problems with were the bullet points that I needed to put in the main html file, but after some troubleshooting it was resolved easily. The same goes with importing an image where I forgot to rename the call image in the html code or to switch .img to .png.
