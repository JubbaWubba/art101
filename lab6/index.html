	<h1> Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
	<div>
		<h1> Challenges </h1>
		<p> One of the challenges that we had encountered was remembering the syntax for creating arrays and objects, nothing a quick google search couldn’t fix. I had tried to copy and paste some code from the last lab and realized that semicolons didn’t work and commas were needed instead for objects. </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1> Problems </h1>
		<p> Once the minor challenges were solved, everything else went pretty smoothly. No other problems occurred in our code/ process. </p>

		<h1> Results </h1>
